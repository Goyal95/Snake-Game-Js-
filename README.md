# Snake-Game-Js

The Snake game is implemented using basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to adhere to the basics of the technologies used.


The Snake can be controlled using arrow keys. The food for the snake is auto generated after the previous one is eaten.


Each normal food is of 1 point.

After every 5-10 seconds, a special 5 point food appears.

It has a background music of queen--I want to break free(just for the fun of it).
